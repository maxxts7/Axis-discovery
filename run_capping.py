"""
Jailbreak capping experiment runner.

Tests activation capping (assistant axis) and PC1 flooring independently
against the JailbreakBench JBB-Behaviors dataset (100 harmful behaviors).

For each behavior, generates:
  - baseline: uncapped model response
  - one capped response per (axis, alpha) — conditions never combined

Alpha controls the threshold percentile: α=0.25 means the cap fires whenever
the projection drops below the 25th percentile of clean calibration projections.

Presets
-------
  sanity   5 behaviors, α=0.25 only — verify hooks fire, metrics populate
  light    20 behaviors, α ∈ {0.1, 0.25, 0.5} — quick threshold comparison
  full     all 100 behaviors, α ∈ {0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75} — complete sweep
  paper    all 100 behaviors, α=0.25 only — exact paper replication setting
  cal_inv  20 behaviors, jbb_cal_raw_inv only — polarity-inverted cal axis test

Run with:
    python run_capping.py [--preset sanity|light|full|paper] [--gpu N]
